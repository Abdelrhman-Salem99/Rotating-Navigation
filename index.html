            <h1>Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
            <p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story
                of
                Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the
                Hokage,
                the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen
                years,
                and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri
                (1995),
                which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year,
                and
                Naruto (1997).

                Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in
                tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced
                by
                Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English adaptation
                of
                the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the
                original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English
                adaptation was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then
                switched
                over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first
                episode.
                The English adaptation is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Besides the anime series,
                Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other
                Naruto-related
                merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.

                Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their
                digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada
                in
                2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most
                OVAs
                from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. Viz
                Media
                began streaming the two anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012. The
                story
                of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto
                wishes
                to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.

            <p>
                Naruto is the fourth best-selling manga series in history, selling 250 million copies worldwide in
                46
                countries, with 153 million of the sales in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere.
                It
                has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes
                have
                appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume
                won a
                Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and
                well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted
                that
                the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology
                and
                Confucianism.
